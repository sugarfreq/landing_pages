        <h1>Automated Appointment Reminders and Communication</h1>
        <p>Keeping a full, efficient schedule is essential to the success of your dental or orthodontic practice, and enables you to provide your patients with the one-on-one attention they deserve. With our automated appointment reminders, patients can customize how they receive appointment reminders and communication from your office with email, text messaging, and/or voicemail. They can also download a reminder for use in their digital calendar, significantly reducing no-show appointments. When missed appointments do occur, you’ll be able to notify patients of their missed appointment with an automatic reminder to reschedule.</p>
