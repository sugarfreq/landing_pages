		<h1>What Doctors Should Know about SEO</h1>

		<p>Search engine optimization, commonly called SEO, is a marketing technique that improves how your practice performs in search engines like Google. Though SEO techniques change rapidly to keep pace with algorithm updates, these are some of the most consistent areas of focus:</p>

		<ul class="bulletlist">
			<li><strong>Strategy</strong>. Before diving in, we carefully consider your current ranking, your available budget, and the competition in your area. Understanding basics like these allow us to get the most out of the resources at hand.</li>

			<li><strong>Keyword Research</strong>. Intensive keyword research shows us which keyword phrases are likely to be most effective. With this information, we can strategically select specific keywords in order to make your SEO campaign as efficient as possible.</li>

			<li><strong>Onsite Optimization</strong>. Even Google has its preferences, and onsite optimization is the practice of tweaking your website to appeal to Google’s taste.</li>

			<li><strong>Offsite Optimization</strong>. The optimization doesn’t stop with your own website. Google and other search engines are smart enough to consult outside sources before passing judgment on your relevance and ranking.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Officite’s Search Specialists are singularly devoted to remaining current and effective in an ever-changing field. That means you, and your practice, get to stay ahead of the SEO curve.</p>

		<h1>What Doctors Should Know about <br> Pay-per-Click Advertising</h1>

		<p>The pay-per-click advertising model, with Google AdWords being the most popular and effective platform, is a proven winner, offering the following advantages:</p>

		<ul class="bulletlist">
			<li><strong>Immediacy</strong>: Ads are displayed to searchers at the exact time they are looking for your services.</li>
			<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: Ads, when properly written, are precisely relevant to the search being conducted.</li>
			<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Unlike SEO, PPC enables advertisers to attack a very large number of keywords within a reasonable budget.</li>
			<li><strong>Geographic Targeting</strong>: Ads can be made to display in a defined geography of the advertiser’s choosing.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost Effectiveness</strong>: Ad budgets are fully under the advertiser’s control; ads cost nothing until a user clicks on one.</li>
		</ul>
